Snowhub is a great theme but it has so many colors that it feels like a kid at one point. Although I agreed to all of those colors while developing the theme, after using it for so long I felt it was time to change it.

Snowhub is basically a short version of Snowflat.

If you like the theme, leave your word for it (it helps keep me motivated). I think I will revise this theme in the future too so I would be glad if anyone would like to join it.


<h1>Installation</h1>
Upload the theme in qa-theme folder.
Select the theme SnowLight on General page in admin section.
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
The changes are mostly cosmetic. It is probably okay for production environments, but may not work exactly as expected. Refunds will not be given. If it breaks, you get to keep both parts.
